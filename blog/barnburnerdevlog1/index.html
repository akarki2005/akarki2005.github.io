        <h1>Barn Burner Devlog 1 - Faceoff!</h1>
        <p>November 5th, 2024</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For those who don't watch hockey, the term barn burner is typically used to describe a hockey game that is very high-scoring and fast-paced. <br>
            These types of games are quite enjoyable to watch as a neutral fan; lots of goals, lots of hits, lots of fights and plenty of tension throughout. <br>
            But how do you replicate the feelings that these games can invoke within a video game? That is what I set out to answer when creating Barn Burner. <br>
            <br>
            Towards the end of July, I began teaching myself the Godot game engine through a series of Youtube videos of varying quality and comphrehensibility. <br>
            While most of these videos were either too hand-holdy or hand-wavy, they did slowly allow me to grasp the basic concepts of game development within <br>
            the Godot engine. Before long, I had created my very own pong game, a game whose physics ended up forming the basis of puck movement in Barn Burner.<br>
            <br>
            At the same time, I began to dive into the world of pixel art and Aseprite, once again through a series of hand-holdy or hand-wavy Youtube videos. <br>
            Each day, I set out to create a new piece of art, whether it be a palm tree, an apple or a katana. None of the early art I created was any good, but <br>
            creating it allowed me to learn important pixel art techniques such as dithering and shading/anti-aliasing - techniques I am still improving upon to <br>
            this day. <br>
            <br>
            With my newfound knowledge of Godot and Aseprite, I spent about a week creating the alpha v1.0 version of Barn Burner. During this time, I worked on <br>
            implementing the basic features of the game that would allow you to play from start to finish, albeit without many of the planned features I wanted <br>
            that would make the game more fast-paced and exciting; that is, make the game a barn burner. Player and puck movement, score and time keeping, and an <br>
            overtime system were the main sections of code that I wrote. As for art, I kept it simple as well, creating 32 sprites for the 32 playable teams in the <br>
            game, as well as some basic UI art like buttons, arrows and the game scoreboard. In addition, my first ever animated sprite made it into alpha v1.0, in <br>
            the form of a goal light that turns on and revolves after a goal is scored. <br>
            <br>
            After completing alpha v1.0, I admittedly lost my motivation for continuing to work on the game, in spite of the countless features left unimplemented. <br>
            Thankfully, a few weeks ago, that motivation returned once again, and I began to get to work on alpha v1.1. I decided that, moving forward, updates to <br>
            the game would be small, with only 1 big feature contained in each one, with some smaller changes as well. That way, I could get updates finished more <br>
            easily, rather than falling into the trap of excessive scope creep. For 1.1, I decided to work on a boosting mechanic, which has hopefully increased the <br>
            pace of games and the overall skill ceiling as well. With a boost meter to keep an eye on and 5 controls instead of 4, it should be harder to master the <br>
            game than it was before, and I am hoping for it to translate into more competitive games between opponents. <br>
            <br>
            So what's next for Barn Burner? Staying on the theme of increasing the pace and excitement, I am currently working on implementing power-ups that spawn <br> 
            periodically throughout the game, giving players the opportunity to temporarily buff themselves or debuff their opponent. Moreover, I am working to add <br>
            sound effects to the game, and revamp much of the art as well (primarily the hockey rink design). I can't promise all of these will make their way into <br>
            alpha v1.2, and I also can't promise a release date for alpha v1.2 either, but rest assured that... actually don't. I might just never finish. <br>
